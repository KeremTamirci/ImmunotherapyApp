            <p>Hello everyone. I want to talk about our project ImmunoTracker which me, Hakan Altay Karata≈ü, and my project mates Ata Erden, Hakan Kerem Tamirci, and Zeynep Tekin have worked very hard on.</p>
            <p><strong>First a little backstory.</strong></p>
            <p>Almost 10 percent of children have a food allergy, a great number of those children visit the emergency room with severe symptoms. Oral immunotherapy treatment can greatly reduce the likelihood of these children ever having anaphylaxis and having to visit the emergency room. But this treatment is a long process where patients can feel alone. Our app is a comprehensive solution that supports parents, children, and physicians throughout the entire treatment journey.</p>
